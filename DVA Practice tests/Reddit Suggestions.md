### Suggested Study Sections
- Study Organizations well, some common patterns it can facilitate, and the services it can interacts with (Config, Firewall Manager, CloudFormation, Resource Access Manager, Control Tower, Cloudtrail).
- Know your deployment types and their advantages and disadvantages
- The Code* suite features extensively for SDLC questions. Building a simple pipeline yourself will get you 90% of the way there.
- When in doubt, the answer is either Config or EventBridge.
- Config
    - AWS Config Managed rules (multiple questions testing if there is a managed rule for a scenario or if you would need to make a custom one)
- CodeDeploy
    - Make sure to know the hooks and when to use them (BeforeInstall, AfterInstall, ApplicationStop, ApplicationStart)
- AWS Orgs
    - SCPs mostly
- ECS/EKS/Fargate
- EventBridge
- IAM Identity Center
