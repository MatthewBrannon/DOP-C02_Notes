1. Know [[Cloudwatch]] like the back of your hand - logs, events, metrics, triggers. what services integrate with it.

2. [[CodePipeline]], [[CodeBuild]], [[CodeDeploy]] - know the lifecycle well. Testing, rollbacks. Would at least test out building a pipeline to deploy a [[lambda]] function, also an AMI. Just so you understand the process.

3. Different deployment types across all services - [[CodePipeline]], [[EC2]], EB, CFN, [[Lambda]], [[API Gateway]]. Know how to do a canary, blue-green, and rolling in each.

4. Was a few questions about [[DynamoDB]] - one in particular where I had to design a sort/primary key and a LSI/GSI. Was only one question but still..

5. AutoScaling/Launch Configs/ELBs. Know them like the back of your hand. Lifecycle hooks will come up for sure.

6. Amazon Macie, Quick Sight, Personal Health Dashboard came up a few times as well. Just be aware of they do.

7. [[RDS]] - DR scenarios, CFN scenarios, cross-region read replicas (which engines support it).

8. [[Elastic Beanstalk]] - understand ebextensions as well as the deployment types.

9. Understand container deployment lifecycle - [[ECS]], [[ECR]], and maybe EB.

10. [[Route 53]] comes up a lot. Know how it plays into different scenarios.. DR, B/G deployment, Canary, etc.
